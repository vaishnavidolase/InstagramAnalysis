# InstagramAnalysis Project

## Overview

InstagramAnalysis is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project centered around Instagram data. 
The provided Jupyter Notebook, `InstagramAnalysis.ipynb`, demonstrates a thorough exploration of Instagram insights using Python and popular data science libraries.
The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a machine learning model to predict impressions based on various engagement metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud scikit-learn
Data
The project utilizes the "Instagram data.csv" dataset for analysis. Ensure that this dataset is present in the same directory as the notebook.
The dataset should include relevant metrics such as likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, follows, and impressions.
Data Cleaning and Exploration:
The notebook begins with a comprehensive data cleaning process, handling missing values and ensuring data integrity. It proceeds to exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unveil patterns and insights within the Instagram dataset.

Visualizations:
Utilizing Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and WordCloud, the project creates visualizations to represent distributions, relationships, and word frequencies within captions and hashtags.

Machine Learning Model:
A PassiveAggressiveRegressor from scikit-learn is employed to build a machine learning model. The model is trained on engagement metrics (likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, follows) to predict impressions. The notebook includes model training, evaluation, and a demonstration of making predictions.
